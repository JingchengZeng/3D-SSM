## Introduction

This repository is the code implementation of the paper 

The current branch has been tested on Linux system, PyTorch 2.1.1 and CUDA 11.8, supports Python 3.10.


## Updates

ðŸŒŸ **2024.11.06** Released the 3D-SSM project.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Linux system, Windows is not tested, depending on whether `causal-conv1d` and `mamba-ssm` can be installed
- Python 3.8+, recommended 3.10
- PyTorch 2.0 or higher, recommended 2.1.1
- CUDA 11.8 or higher, recommended 11.8

### Environment Installation

It is recommended to use VMamba for installation. The following commands will create a virtual environment named `3d-ssm` and install PyTorch. In the following installation steps, the default installed CUDA version is **11.8**. 

Note: If you are experienced with PyTorch and have already installed it, you can skip to the next section. Otherwise, you can follow the steps below.

**Step 1**: Create a virtual environment named `3d-ssm` and activate it.

```shell
conda create -n 3d-ssm python=3.10
conda activate 3d-ssm
```

**Step 2**: Install dependencies.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note**: If importing mamba fails, please download the corresponding package at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/releases.

## Dataset Preparation


### Remote Sensing Change Detection Dataset

We provide the method of preparing the remote sensing change detection dataset used in the paper.

- [WHU-CD Dataset](Fully convolutional networks for multisource building extraction from an open aerial and satellite imagery data set)

- [LEVIR-CD Dataset](A spatial-temporal attention-based method and a new dataset for remote sensing image change detection.)

- [CDD Dataset](change detection in remote sensing images using conditional adversarial networks)
- [SYSU Dataset](A deeply supervised attention metric-based network and an open aerial image dataset for remote sensing change detection.)
- [DSIFN Dataset](A deeply supervised image fusion network for change detection in high resolution bi-temporal remote sensing images.)


#### Organization Method

You can also choose other sources to download the data, but you need to organize the dataset in the following formatï¼š

```
